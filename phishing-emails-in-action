## 1. Introduction

Social engineering attacks often rely on phishing emails to manipulate users into performing unsafe actions. These emails are designed to look legitimate while hiding malicious intent. Understanding how phishing emails operate is essential for preventing data breaches and unauthorized access.

This write-up documents my learning experience from the **Phishing Emails in Action** exercise on TryHackMe. The lab focuses on analyzing real-world phishing email examples and identifying the techniques attackers use to deceive victims.

## 2. Objectives

The objectives of this exercise are:
- To analyze real phishing email samples
- To identify indicators of phishing in email content
- To understand attacker tactics used in social engineering
- To improve email security awareness and detection skills

---

## 3. Exercise Overview

In this exercise, multiple phishing emails were examined to identify malicious characteristics. The lab emphasizes **practical analysis** by reviewing real email samples rather than theoretical explanations.

Key elements analyzed include:
- Sender information
- Email subject lines
- Embedded links and URLs
- Attachments
- Message content and tone

---

## 4. Methodology (High-Level Walkthrough)

> ⚠️ This section focuses on defensive analysis only.

### 4.1 Sender and Domain Analysis
The sender’s email address was analyzed to verify its legitimacy. Mismatched domains, spoofed sender names, and unusual email formats were treated as phishing indicators.

### 4.2 Subject Line Evaluation
Subject lines were reviewed for:
- Urgency (e.g., account suspension warnings)
- Fear-based or reward-based language
- Generic or misleading messages

### 4.3 URL and Link Analysis
Embedded links were examined for:
- Suspicious or shortened URLs
- Domains that impersonate trusted services
- Redirects to unknown or unsafe websites

### 4.4 Attachment Inspection
Attachments were reviewed based on:
- File type and extension
- Unexpected or unsolicited attachments
- Files designed to trick users into enabling macros

### 4.5 Content and Psychological Tactics
The email body was analyzed for:
- Requests for sensitive information
- Impersonation of trusted organizations
- Social engineering techniques such as urgency, fear, and authority

---

## 5. Key Findings

During the analysis, several phishing techniques were identified:
- Impersonation of well-known companies or services
- Urgent calls to action forcing quick decisions
- Suspicious sender addresses and spoofed domains
- Embedded links leading to fake login pages
- Attachments intended to deliver malicious payloads

These techniques are commonly used in modern phishing campaigns.

---

## 6. Lessons Learned

From this exercise, I learned that:
- Phishing emails often appear convincing at first glance
- Careful inspection of sender details and URLs is critical
- Attackers rely on emotional manipulation to succeed
- User awareness is a key defense against social engineering

---

## 7. Conclusion

The **Phishing Emails in Action** exercise provided valuable hands-on experience in identifying phishing emails. By analyzing real-world examples, I gained a better understanding of how attackers craft deceptive messages and how such threats can be detected and prevented.

This exercise strengthened my practical phishing analysis skills and improved my overall cybersecurity awareness.
